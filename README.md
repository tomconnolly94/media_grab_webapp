Media Grab
========

### The Idea ###

This project is designed to be a simple framework frontend for the [media_grab](https://github.com/tomconnolly94/media_grab) system. It is a Vue.js web app with a python flask backend that facilitates edits to the mediaIndex.json file which is the single source of truth for media download targets.

## Installation

The system is built and run with Docker to prevent time being wasted on managing dependencies. Simply clone the project and run `docker-compose up --build` from the project's root directory.

## Tests

Tests are located in the `test/` directory, and the unit tests inside the `test/unit_test` directory. Run the tests from the project root directory with this command: `python -m unittest discover -v -s .`
